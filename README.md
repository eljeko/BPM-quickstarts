# BPM-quickstarts

A set BPM Suite 6 Quickstart labs used at the SKO FY16 technical session

the quickstarts are indipendent projects that you can build separately. Suggestion is to build in the suggested order because some of them are dependencies of others. And because they follow a path accordingly with the slides of the SKO session.

These Quickstarts consist of the following projects:

##assets
Imagine a company where you are working for, making a demo, implementing a Proof Of Concept or collaborating with your consultant collegues in a GPS delivery project.
Imagine the company wants to have different development teams for different topics, so for example a team that works on datamodel design and implementation, a team that works on basic common assets (rules & processes) and other teams working on end user applications.
This quickstart project is very simple but has the purpose of demonstrating this approach.
Just 

##basicapps 

##datamodel 

##rules     

##weblab
